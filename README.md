# MiCasa Mobile Application



## Project Description

MiCasa is a mobile application designed to help homeowners manage home service requests, bids, and service history in a single centralized platform. The application simplifies communication between homeowners and service providers while reducing confusion, missed appointments, and lost information.



## Problem Being Addressed

Homeowners commonly use phone calls, text messages, emails, and paper notes to manage home services. This scattered approach makes it difficult to track pricing, schedules, and past work. MiCasa solves this issue by organizing all home service activity in one mobile application.



## Platform

MiCasa is designed as an Android-based mobile application. The platform supports smartphones and tablets and is designed to scale for future expansion to iOS and web-based solutions.



## Front-End and Back-End Support

The front end includes login screens, a dashboard, service request forms, bid comparison views, and service history pages.  

The back end supports user authentication, data storage, request processing, bid management, and service status tracking.



## Functionality

- Create and manage home service requests  

- Receive and compare bids from service providers  

- Track service status and appointments  

- Maintain a history of completed services  



## Design (Wireframes)

Wireframes were created to plan screen layout, navigation, and user flow. These include login screens, dashboards, request forms, bid comparison views, and service history screens. The design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use.



## Project Goals


The goal of this project is to design, document, and present the MiCasa application concept using professional development practices and GitHub documentation tools.
